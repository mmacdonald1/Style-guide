# Style-guide

## Before we style ...

Before you begin the process of deciding the styles that make up your app's personality, you need to be in touch with what that personality is.  You need to know at minimum your app's purpose and user story. 
Purpose is just answering what is the purpose of your site? 
A user story is a breif script about who would use your app "As a <role>, I want <feature> so that <reason>." Having a fleshed out idea of who your user is and what they want is the best approach to making major app decisions. Visualizing someone you know very well who would use your app is the easiest option. The idea is that if you design an app for a single user you end up creating features that would appeal to a large group of people.
 
## Look & Feel

Look and feel encompasses personality, mood, and tone. 
Personality tends to be a human-like characteristic such as "friendly"
